# No Man's Sky Mods
By "popular" request, I will upload mods that I create to this repository. Updates will be sporatic and will continue until either I lose interest in No Man's Sky (not likely) or Hello Games stops releasing updates (also, seemingly unlikely).

## No Ladder Latch (4.12 - Steam Build 10661718)
Disables latching behavior on ladders of all kinds, requiring the player to hold the interact button to start climbing a ladder.

## No Terrain Edits (4.12 - Steam Build 10661718)
Disables the "auto carve" behavior of base parts while building a base; placing base parts will allow them to clip into terrain rather than automatically editing the terrain, preventing unwanted edit creep and future automatic fill-in.

## Freighter Buildable Tech and NTE (4.12 - Steam Build 10661718)
WARNING: There are a lot of cosmetic oddities with this mod. Only use this if you don't mind some purely cosmetic strangeness.

By request, this mod reactivates a number of legacy freighter tech (such as hydroponics trays, medium refiners, etc.) as well as the Expedition 9 consoles (if you have them) on freighters and merges it with No Terrain Edits. SNAPPING IS NOT WORKING; I have not figured out yet how to re-enable snapping legacy tech like hydroponics trays or the Galactic Trade Terminal to legacy rooms, but they otherwise work.


# Deprecated Mods

## MP Freighter
Hello Games has made it so that multiple player freighters can exist in a single system, but you can only see and interact with another freighter if you dismiss your on. Consequently, an option to dismiss your frieghter has been added. This is a fair compromise to prevent multiplayer refiner issues, so I will no longer maintain or distribute this mod.


# Pre-emptive FAQ
## What branch are you based on?
All mods I create are based on the experimental branch. However, I generally only update when Experimental and Public are at parity unless there's a critical update on experimental. Whatever the case, I will always provide the patch version next to the name on this page.
## When do you update mods?
All mod updates are dictated by updates to MBINCompiler and experimental patch swarms. In general, I update anywhere between a week and a month after the release of a major patch.
## Why not release on Nexus?
Because Nexus stripped mod authors of their rights and I will never support their business (yes, they are a business as much as they'd like you to believe otherwise) again.
## Why no AMUMSS scripts?
Because I'm Lua illiterate. Sorry.
