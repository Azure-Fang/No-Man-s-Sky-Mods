# No-Man-s-Sky-Mods
By "popular" request, I will upload mods that I create to this repository. Updates will be sporatic and will continue until either I lose interest in No Man's Sky (not likely) or Hello Games stops releasing updates (also, seemingly unlikely).

## No Ladder Latch (4.05 - Steam Build 9763858)
Disables latching behavior on ladders of all kinds, requiring the player to hold the interact button to start climbing a ladder.

## MP Freighter (4.05 - Steam Build 9763858)
Disables the lockout on player freighters, allowing any number of player freighters in a single system. This is a "client side" effect: If you, with this mod installed, travel to a system that already has an another active player frieghter, you will be allowed to summon your frighter and the existing freighter will remain unaffected, but additional players will still be unable to summon their frieghter unless they install the mod as well.

## No Terrain Edits (4.05 - Steam Build 9763858)
Disables the "auto carve" behavior of base parts while building a base; placing base parts will allow them to clip into terrain rather than automatically editing the terrain, preventing unwanted edit creep and future automatic fill-in.

# Pre-emptive FAQ
## What branch are you based on?
All mods I create are based on the experimental branch. However, I generally only update when Experimental and Public are at parity unless there's a critical update on experimental. Whatever the case, I will always provide the patch version next to the name on this page.
## When do you update mods?
All mod updates are dictated by updates to MBINCompiler and experimental patch swarms. In general, I update anywhere between a week and a month after the release of a major patch.
## Why not release on Nexus?
Because Nexus stripped mod authors of their rights and I will never support their business (yes, they are a business as much as they'd like you to believe otherwise) again.
